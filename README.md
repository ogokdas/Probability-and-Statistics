# Probability and Statistics

## Course Overview
This course provides an applied introduction to probability and statistics for engineering students. 
The focus is on understanding core concepts and applying them to real-world problems using Python, 
Jupyter notebooks, and practical datasets.

## Course Structure
- **Syllabus**: Official course outline and weekly plan  
- **Lectures**: PDF lecture notes and Jupyter notebooks  
- **Datasets**: Example datasets used in demonstrations and assignments  

Some lecture notes may cover more than one week depending on the course pace.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Summarize and describe data using graphical and numerical methods  
- Understand and apply basic probability concepts and distributions  
- Work with random variables and sampling distributions  
- Construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests  
- Use Python and Jupyter notebooks to carry out basic statistical analyses
